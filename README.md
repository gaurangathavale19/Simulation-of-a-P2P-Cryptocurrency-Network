# Simulation-of-a-P2P-Cryptocurrency-Network

## How to run the code ?
- Install the libraries from the file requirements.txt using the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the code with the following command-line arguments:
  - n_peers: Number of peers
  - slow_nodes: Percetage of slow nodes/peers
  - lowCPU_nnodes: Percentage of low CPU nodes/peers
  - txn_mean_time: Mean interarrival time between transactions
  - blk_mean_time: Mean interarrival time between blocks
  - terminations_time: The time after which the simulation will come to an halt
